# IIRS_ISRO_Internship_Project
This project, developed during my IIRS ISRO internship, uses a custom ResNet50 model for building identification in Delhi NCR from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. It addresses challenges like low resolution and data quality, contributing to urban planning and sustainable development through automated urban infrastructure detection.
